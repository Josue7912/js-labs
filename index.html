        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>An appreciation of the most common program in the world.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>No one particularly likes doing "Hello World" programs, and everyone has skipped over them, sooner or later. Why should someone go through a guided example of a useless program? It is a fair question, but it is a question that misses the point.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is not about making something useful, it is about showing you the basic template of the language or framework you are using. It is like the training level of a video game. You press <code>A</code> to jump, here is a save point, there is something that will get you into trouble. Maybe you are so experienced with these types of games that you skip the training levels and get right into it and work it out. To be fair, this works for most video games, except, most video games have at most 10 distinct actions you can take. Jump, walk, run, shoot, interact... in programming, you have a seemingly infinite number of actions available to you. So, do yourself a favor and take the time to get familiar with the basics.</p>
